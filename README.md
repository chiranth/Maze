# Maze

Our project focusses on creating a maze using a stack and to nd the solution
to the maze.The 'recursive backtracking'(BFS or DFS) method is used to nd
a path through the maze. The stack is implemented using a linked list.We use
the GNU C Compiler to generate the object code and the 'LATEX' editor to
generate the Software Requirements Specication document.Our document will
be as per the IEEE standards . The only input will be the size of the maze in
terms of rows and columns.The output will be 2 gures, each of the maze, one
before nding the path and the other one after.The maze is displayed in the
'.svg' format.This system will be helpful to travellers in the GPS application .
